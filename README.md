StarForge: A C++ Survival Game
StarForge is a lightweight, console-based 2D survival game written in C++. Explore a grid-based map, collect resources (ore and energy), craft protective shields, and survive random meteor showers. This project showcases object-oriented programming, game loop design, and random event handling in C++.
Features

Dynamic Map: Navigate a 10x10 grid to collect resources.
Crafting System: Use resources to craft shields to protect against hazards.
Random Events: Survive meteor showers that spawn hazards on the map.
Simple Controls: Use WASD to move, 'c' to craft, and 'q' to quit.

How to Play

Clone the repository: git clone <your-repo-url>
Compile the game: g++ StarForge.cpp -o StarForge
Run the game: ./StarForge (Linux/Mac) or StarForge.exe (Windows)
Use WASD keys to move, collect Ore ('O') and Energy ('E'), and avoid Hazards ('X').
Press 'c' to craft a shield if you have enough resources.
Survive as long as possible!
